  Begun drawing backgrounds
  Questioning current visual style as there is no vibe
    | Background and foreground should not be separate

    | How important is vibe? Many games don't have a vibe but still have a cohesive style
  Tested out parallax layers and an example background and found parallax layers do not inherit parent visibility

  Fixed portals spawning you far away from area boundaries
    Simply realized that exit area2d was not used and that shifted everything inward
