  | Finished smash bounce code, animation is pending till art style has been solidified
  | Created three new areas at the beginning of the game for skill training
  | Changed naming system from coordinates to description of purpose
    | This means areas can be put between  other areas without the need to rename every single other room. It also works to better identify what each room is and create purpose for why it exists 
    | This does make conceptualizing space more difficult and will make an external program necessary to keep track necessary in the future

  Begun drawing backgrounds
  Questioning current visual style as there is no vibe
    | Background and foreground should not be separate
    | Foreground is too flat even though there is plenty of color depth
    | How important is vibe? Many games don't have a vibe but still have a cohesive style
  Tested out parallax layers and an example background and found parallax layers do not inherit parent visibility

  Fixed portals spawning you far away from area boundaries
    Simply realized that exit area2d was not used and that shifted everything inward
